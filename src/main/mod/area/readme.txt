This is a readme generated by Java code.

Put your custom maps in this folder, and start the game. This will allow the game to load your
custom maps into the game, and take advantage of the editor's basic capabilities. But, the game
will then no longer load the default maps that were there, unless all of the custom maps have
been removed, or the game has been placed in a separate folder.

All custom maps must be created and saved by the editor. The file format of the maps is PNG.

Note that the game first sorts your maps in alphabetical order, then apply IDs according to
the order of the sorted maps, from first to last. Here's an example:

"my_area.png", "my_cave.png"

The first map has the ID of 1, the second map has the ID of 2. If there are more maps, it
continues counting up. 3, 4, 5, and so on. Use these generated IDs for your editor, if you
want to have area connections in the OverWorld. Please read the specifications hosted at
GitHub (link down below) for more information on applying area connections in the level editor.
