By line order (Specific --> Abstract):

---------------- (Aug 22, 2021) -------------------

TODO:
1. Revisit this todo.txt file and check what needs to be updated. Some of the backlogged tasks no longer applies to many of the new changes right now.

---------------- (Jun 03, 2021) -------------------

TODO:
1. Level Editor has a broken "Load Map". "Save Map" saves extra metadata, that the "Load Map" needs to address.

---------------- (Nov 23, 2020) -------------------

TODO: Redesign the Script Editor UI, so that only:
1. Level Editor can save and load both map area and script files.
2. Level Editor determines where to save/load the map area and script files from.
3. Level Editor should allow the user to save/load the map area from the official "area" directory, official "script" directory, or the all-in-one "mod" directory.
4. If the user chooses a directory not from these 3 places, both the map area and the script files will be saved together.
5. If the user chooses the "area" directory or "script" directory, then the map area will be saved to the "area" directory, and scripts to the "script" directory.
6. If the user chooses the "mod" directory, the map area will be saved to the "mod/area" directory, the script files will be saved in the "mod/script" directory.
7. When loading an area file or a script file, use the checksum to determine where the required files are at, from these places.
8. If no required files were detected, do not attempt to continue loading the level editor session. Throw some dialog messages or something to warn the user.

BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THIS LIST OF TODOs:

Open the project and look at the Tasks view. That contains the full list othings needed to be done. Contains (FIXME) Area.java and (TODO).


DEBUG (NewDialogue.java): Needs testing to see if there's any problem with	NewDialogue.
DEBUG (MainComponent.java): Uncomment this line if you feel debugging and switching window focus from IDE to game and back is nauseous.
TODO (11/24/2014) (WorldConstants.java): Make map more flexible by allowing scripting files of different filenames to be loaded. Not sure where it was being loaded.
TODO (6/18/2015) (Area.java): Door needs to be checked for null areas. If null areas are found, default to locked doors.
TODO (6/19/2015) (PixelData.java): 0x05000003 is a water tile in the level editor, but it's really not a water tile.
TODO (6/19/2015) (WorldConstants.java): Check to see why there's a need to load "aas.script".
TODO (6/19/2015) (PixelData.java): Make the borders a bit more thicker. Possibly the land border near the edges of the water tiles.
TODO: (2014-6-26) (ScriptEditor.java): Add the ability to save temp script data on the fly. Closing included.
TODO (OverWorld.java): Add a method that executes according to the sector ID. 
TODO (EditorConstants.java): Add additional pixel data properties that can be edited/modified for the area.
TODO (Area.java): Add area type.
