# Contribution

### Disclaimer

This started off as a hobby programming project, so there's bound to be bad practices of Java coding. But, fear not. As the project progresses along, the code itself will eventually become better.

As long as these criterias are met, any code can be eligible for submission:

 - All class members must start with "this".

 Example:

         public class Foo {
             int bar;
             public Foo (int value){
                  this.bar = value;    //<-------  The member, "bar", is prefixed with "this".
            }
         }

 - Javax.Swing for GUI stuffs is used. (Level Editor + Script Editor)

I know you may be adamant on not using Swing or anything related to Swing, but that is how this project started off, with a lot of GUI codes went into Swing, setting variables on Swing layouts, and all that. 

For each contribution, as long as it doesn't break any functionality, the codebase is explained clearly with Javadoc (optional), the codebase is readable, it will be merged into the master branch.

If there's any questions, you are free to send a message to my Twitter account, @asperatology.
